Here is an OSINT app for geolocation using Python and the Google Maps API.

Before running this code, make sure to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Google Maps API key. 

You can get a key by creating a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, enabling the Google Maps API, and creating an API key.

This script uses the googlemaps library to interact with the Google Maps API. 

It first tries to geolocate the address using the Google Maps API. 

If the API fails, it falls back to using the geopy library with the Nominatim geocoder, which is based on the OpenStreetMap data.

The geolocate function takes an address as input and returns the latitude and longitude coordinates. If the address is not found, it returns None.

You can run this script by calling the geolocate function with the desired address as an argument. The script will print the latitude and longitude coordinates if the geolocation is successful.

Note: The Google Maps API has usage limits and quotas. Make sure to handle exceptions and manage API usage properly to avoid exceeding these limits.
